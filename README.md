Some older and some newer configs and scripts.  
Let me know if you have ideas for improvements, corrections or if you think something is missing - thanks! :-)

I generally strive to write my scripts POSIX compliant, with sh as the shell, 
so they can run with `dash` as it uses less resources.

I've left most comments in as they may be helpful to some of you, as they are to me.

## WM / Distro history

fluxbuntu -> debian lxde -> arch linux

fluxbox -> openbox -> awesome -> dwm -> xmonad -> i3 -> bspwm

dwm_status(?) -> xmobar -> i3bar -> polybar

most switches are mostly just to try something new.
Since I've been switching WM's I'm trying to take as much configuration out of the WM as possible (fx. hotkeys), 
so most still works if I switch again.
